    abstract = {Links between pull-requests and the issues they address document and accelerate the development of a software project, but are often omitted. We present a new tool, Aide-m\'{e}moire, to suggest such links when a developer submits a pull-request or closes an issue, smoothly integrating into existing workflows. In contrast to previous state of the art approaches that repair related commit histories, Aide-m\'{e}moire is designed for continuous, real-time and long-term use, employing Mondrian Forests to adapt over a project’s lifetime and continuously improve traceability. Aide-m\'{e}moire is tailored for two specific instances of the general traceability problem — namely, commit to issue and pull-request (PR) to issue links, with a focus on the latter — and exploits data inherent to these two problems to outperform tools for general purpose link recovery. Our approach is online, language-agnostic, and scalable. We evaluate over a corpus of 213 projects and six programming languages, achieving a mean average precision of 0.95. Adopting Aide-m\'{e}moire is both efficient and effective: a programmer need only evaluate a single suggested link  (94% )  of the time, and  (16% )  of all discovered links were originally missed by developers.},
