description: <details><summary><b style="font-size:1.17em;">Brief Bio</b></summary><p>Currently a freelance researcher with a keen interest on Machine Learning approaches to Software Engineering. My interests lie in structured approaches to modeling source code, program synthesis, understanding defect prediction, and the testing oracle problem. I received my PhD from <a href="http://ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a>, where I worked under the supervision of <a href="http://earlbarr.com/">Prof. Earl T. Barr</a> on improving project health by applying Machine Learning to problems from Software Engineering. Some of my projects are listed on this page.</p><br><p>In a long forgotten age, I used to take photographs as well, try to do so today as well. Some of these can be found <a href="https://partachi.com/photos.html">here</a>.</p></details>
