description: Currently a freelance researcher with a keen interest on Machine Learning approaches to Software Engineering. My interests lie in structured approaches to modeling source code, program synthesis, understanding defect prediction, and the testing oracle problem. I got my PhD from <a href="http://ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a> where I worked under the supervision of <a href="http://earlbarr.com/">Prof Earl T. Barr</a> on improving project health by applying Machine Learning to problems from Software Engineering. Some of my projects are listed on this page.
