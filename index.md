# Profir-Petru Pârțachi's Homepage

I am a PhD Student at University College London working with Dr Earl T. Barr, http://earlbarr.com/, on improving project health by applying Machine Learning to problems from Software Engineering. Some of my projects are listed on this page.

# Projects

## Projects part of my Doctoral work under the supervision of [Dr. Earl T. Barr](http://earlbarr.com/).

1. Aide-memoire: A tool to link issues and pull-requests in an online fashion by predicting which issues(PRs) relate to other PRs(issues). It makes use of a Mondrian Forest model that should be trained on a project before it can make predictions. It is composed of a backend([GitHub Link](https://github.com/PPPI/a-m)) and a Chrome plug-in to interface with the backend([GitHub Link](https://github.com/PPPI/tlinker-chrome))

1. POSIT: A tool that makes use of a CRF-biLSTM model to segment and tag text that mixes English and code snippets. It was trained on a compination of C code and StackOverflow. [Project Page](https://pppi.github.io/POSIT)

1. Flexeme: A tool that untangles commits into atomic patches using graph kernel similarity and aggomerative clustering. It was validated on an artificial corpus of tangled commits for 9 C# projects. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/PPPI/Flexeme)
